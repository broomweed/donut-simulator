## Donut Simulator

Welcome to *Donut Simulator*, the program that completely fails to live up to its name.

#### If it doesn't simulate donuts, then what does it do?

This is a population simulator! It creates a bunch of circles which can observe their environment, move around, eat, and reproduce, and simulates them living in an environment with randomly-generated "trees" which they can eat. Successful ones live to reproduce and have children, and eventually become the masters of the technicolor forest. It's loads of fun (and loads of processor-melting floating-point operations!) To use the terms of art, it's pretty much a genetic algorithm for neural networks.

#### Why is it called Donut Simulator?

The world that these organisms inhabit wraps at the edges. This means that their world is shaped like a *toroid*, aka approximately a donut.

#### What do I need to experience this simulationy goodness?

You'll need **Python 3**, as well as the **pygame** library. I think that's it?

#### Is it finished?

No!!
